## 🔧 API Endpoints Used

The testing interface uses these backend endpoints:

### 1. `GET /debug/find-event/<search_term>`
**Purpose:** Search events by name  
**Returns:** List of matching events with sync analysis

**Example:**
```
GET /debug/find-event/breakfast
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "search_term": "breakfast",
  "found_count": 1,
  "events": [{
    "id": "AAMkAD...",
    "subject": "Breakfast with Santa",
    "start": "2024-12-15T09:00:00",
    "categories": ["Public"],
    "showAs": "busy",
    "has_public": true,
    "is_busy": true
  }]
}
```

### 2. `GET /debug/event/<event_id>`
**Purpose:** Get detailed event analysis  
**Returns:** Full event data + sync analysis

**Example:**
```
GET /debug/event/AAMkAD...
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "event": { /* Full Graph API event */ },
  "sync_analysis": {
    "new_logic": {
      "has_public_category": true,
      "is_busy": true,
      "would_sync": true
    }
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Testing page shows "Not authenticated"
**Solution:**
1. Click "Back to Dashboard"
2. Log out
3. Log in again
4. Return to testing page

### Issue: Search returns no events
**Solutions:**
- Try different search terms
- Check date range (searches next 90 days only)
- Verify calendar access permissions

### Issue: Event shows "Would Sync: NO"
**Check:**
1. **Categories:** Must include "Public" (any case)
2. **ShowAs:** Must be busy/tentative/oof/workingElsewhere (not "free")

**Fix:**
1. Open event in Outlook Web
2. Add "Public" category if missing
3. Change "Show As" to "Busy" if set to "Free"
4. Save and test again

### Issue: Sync fails
**Check:**
- Authentication hasn't expired
- Both calendars accessible
- No rate limits exceeded
- Check server logs for errors
