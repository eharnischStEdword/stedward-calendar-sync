# Git workflow (internal rule — do not add to public README)
- Work on `main` only. Do not create or use feature branches.
- Commit and push directly to `main`. Deploys (e.g. Render) are triggered from `main`.
- When suggesting git commands, use `main`; do not suggest creating or pushing to other branches.
