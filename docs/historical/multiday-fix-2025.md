# Multi-Day Event Duplication Fix (January 2025)

## Issue Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Severity:** High - User-visible duplicates in public calendar  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved

### The Problem

Multi-day all-day events (e.g., "Catholic Schools Week" spanning January 26 - February 1, 2025) were being duplicated in the public calendar during sync operations. The same event would appear multiple times, creating confusion for calendar users.

Additionally, the UI would display yellow warning messages after successful background syncs, incorrectly indicating sync failures.

### Symptoms

1. **Calendar Duplicates:** Multi-day events appeared 2-3+ times in the public calendar
2. **Recurring Pattern:** The issue primarily affected all-day events spanning multiple days
3. **False Warnings:** UI showed yellow "‚ö†Ô∏è Last sync had issues" warnings even after successful syncs
4. **Specific Example:** "Catholic Schools Week" (1/26 - 2/1/2025) appeared multiple times

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Signature Instability for All-Day Events

The event signature generation logic included time components for all-day events. When Microsoft Graph API returned all-day events, the time component could vary across:
- Different API calls
- Series masters vs. occurrences
- Different representations of the same event

**Problem Code:**
```python
# Old approach - included time component
start_normalized = normalize_datetime(start_datetime)  # Returns "2025-01-26T00:00"
signature = f"single:{subject}:{start_normalized}:ALLDAY:{location}"
```

This created **different signatures** for the **same logical event**, causing the duplicate detection logic to fail. The system would see:
- `single:catholic schools week:2025-01-26T00:00:ALLDAY:` (from one API call)
- `single:catholic schools week:2025-01-26:ALLDAY:` (from another API call)

And treat them as different events, leading to duplicates.

### Secondary Issue: Background Sync Response Handling

The background sync endpoint returned HTTP 202 (Accepted) to indicate async processing, but the UI interpreted any non-200 status as a failure, displaying warning messages incorrectly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Date-Only Signatures for All-Day Events

Modified `signature_utils.py` to use **date-only** format (no time component) for all-day events:

```python
# New approach - date only for all-day events
is_all_day = event.get('isAllDay', False)
if is_all_day:
    # Extract date portion only, no time
    if 'T' in start_datetime:
        start_normalized = start_datetime.split('T')[0]  # Returns "2025-01-26"
    else:
        start_normalized = start_datetime
else:
    start_normalized = normalize_datetime(start_datetime)
```

**Key Changes:**
- All-day events now use format: `single:catholic schools week:2025-01-26:ALLDAY:`
- Time component completely removed for all-day events
- Consistent signatures across all API responses
- Applied to seriesMaster, occurrence, and singleInstance event types

### 2. Fixed UI Response Handling

Updated background sync response handling to correctly interpret HTTP 202 as success:

```javascript
// app.py - Background sync endpoint
if request_source == 'background':
    return jsonify({
        "message": "Background sync started",
        "sync_in_progress": True,
        "request_source": "background"
    }), 202  # Accepted - async processing
```

The UI now correctly handles 202 responses and doesn't show false warnings.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check for Single Instances

Access the public calendar and verify that multi-day events appear only once:
- "Catholic Schools Week" should appear as a single event spanning the date range
- No duplicate entries with the same name and date range

### 2. UI Status Verification

After a sync completes:
1. Check that the UI shows a green "‚úì" status indicator
2. No yellow warning messages should appear after successful syncs
3. Last sync timestamp should be displayed correctly

### 3. Log Verification

Check application logs for the absence of diagnostic emoji logging:
```bash
# Should return no results after cleanup
grep "üîç" app.log
```

### 4. Debug Endpoint Check

Access `/debug` endpoint to view enhanced all-day event tracking:
- `event_counts.source_multi_day` - Count of multi-day events in source
- `event_counts.target_multi_day` - Count of multi-day events in target
- `all_day_samples` - Sample all-day events from both calendars
- `multi_day_events` - Details of multi-day events with day spans

## Files Modified

### Core Logic Changes
- **`signature_utils.py`** - Updated `generate_event_signature()` to use date-only for all-day events
- **`sync.py`** - No logic changes, removed temporary diagnostic logging
- **`app.py`** - Enhanced `/debug` endpoint with all-day event tracking

### Temporary Diagnostic Code (Removed)
- **`signature_utils.py`** - Removed 4 diagnostic logging blocks
- **`sync.py`** - Removed 3 diagnostic logging blocks
- All `üîç ALL-DAY EVENT DIAGNOSTIC` and `üîç CHECKING ALL-DAY EVENT` logging removed

## Testing Performed

1. ‚úÖ Multi-day events sync without duplicates
2. ‚úÖ Catholic Schools Week appears exactly once in public calendar
3. ‚úÖ UI shows correct status after background sync
4. ‚úÖ No false warning messages
5. ‚úÖ Debug endpoint provides comprehensive all-day event information
6. ‚úÖ Signature generation produces consistent results across API calls

## Deployment Notes

- **Pre-deployment:** Diagnostic logging added to track signature generation
- **Post-deployment:** Waited 24-48 hours to verify fix in production
- **Cleanup:** Removed all temporary diagnostic logging after verification
- **No data migration required** - Fix automatically applies to future syncs
- **Existing duplicates:** May need manual cleanup if present before fix

## Future Considerations

### Prevention
- All signature changes should be tested with all-day events
- Consider adding automated tests for all-day event signature stability
- Multi-day events should be part of standard test scenarios

### Monitoring
- Use `/debug` endpoint to monitor all-day and multi-day event counts
- Check for signature consistency across sync operations
- Monitor for any new patterns of duplication

### Known Limitations
- Fix applies to future syncs; historical duplicates may persist
- Manual verification recommended for critical multi-day events
- Signature format changes require careful testing to avoid reintroducing duplicates
