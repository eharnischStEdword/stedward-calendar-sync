# Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure AD App Registration**
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Tenant ID
   - Redirect URI configured

2. **Calendar Access**
   - Shared mailbox: `calendar@stedward.org`
   - Source calendar: `Calendar`
   - Target calendar: `St. Edward Public Calendar`
   - Appropriate permissions granted

3. **Hosting Platform**
   - Python 3.9+
   - Persistent storage at `/data`
   - Environment variable support

## Environment Variables

Set these in your hosting platform:

```bash
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/callback

SHARED_MAILBOX=calendar@stedward.org
SOURCE_CALENDAR=Calendar
TARGET_CALENDAR=St. Edward Public Calendar

SYNC_CUTOFF_DAYS=1825
SYNC_INTERVAL_MIN=23
MAX_SYNC_REQUESTS_PER_HOUR=20

MASTER_CALENDAR_PROTECTION=true

PORT=10000
TIMEOUT=300
```

## Initial Deployment

### 1. Deploy Application

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/calendar-sync-service.git
cd calendar-sync-service

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables (platform-specific)

# Deploy to hosting platform
```

### 2. Authenticate

After deployment:
1. Visit `https://your-domain.com`
2. Click "Authenticate with Microsoft"
3. Sign in with account that has calendar access
4. Grant requested permissions
5. Verify redirect back to app

Token will be stored in `/data/token.json`.

### 3. Verify Health

```bash
# Basic health
curl https://your-domain.com/health

# Detailed health
curl https://your-domain.com/health/detailed
```

### 4. Test Sync

Trigger first sync via web interface or wait for automatic sync.

Monitor logs for:
- ✅ Events fetched successfully
- ✅ Operations determined
- ✅ Sync completed
- ❌ No errors

## Continuous Deployment

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Deploy Calendar Sync

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest tests/ -v
      
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Your deployment commands
```

## Monitoring Post-Deployment

### First Hour
- [ ] Health endpoint responding
- [ ] No authentication errors
- [ ] First sync completes successfully
- [ ] Events appear in target calendar

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Multiple sync cycles complete
- [ ] No rate limit errors
- [ ] Sync timing consistent
- [ ] No duplicate events created

### Ongoing
- [ ] Daily sync success rate > 95%
- [ ] Response times < 30s
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] Token refresh working

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Fails
1. Verify environment variables set correctly
2. Check Azure AD app registration
3. Ensure redirect URI matches exactly
4. Verify account has calendar permissions

### Syncs Not Running
1. Check scheduler is enabled
2. Verify `SYNC_INTERVAL_MIN` set
3. Check application logs
4. Test manual sync via web interface

### Events Not Syncing
1. Verify events have "Public" category
2. Verify events marked as "Busy"
3. Check date range (within `SYNC_CUTOFF_DAYS`)
4. Review sync logs for filtering reasons

### Duplicates Created
1. Run duplicate cleanup: `python tests/utils/cleanup_tools.py`
2. Check signature generation logs
3. Verify `signature_utils.py` unchanged
4. Review `test_signatures.py` results

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment causes issues:

```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or rollback to specific tag
git checkout [previous-tag]
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

Monitor health endpoints after rollback.

## Updating Dependencies

```bash
# Update requirements
pip list --outdated
pip install --upgrade [package]
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Test thoroughly before deploying
pytest tests/ -v

# Deploy with updated requirements
```

## Security Updates

1. Review Azure AD permissions regularly
2. Rotate client secret annually
3. Monitor for unusual sync patterns
4. Keep dependencies updated
5. Review access logs monthly
